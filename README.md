### JVM based Game Engine
GdxMachine is game engine built on top of popular JVM based framework for game development
[libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
It provides a extensible & beginner friendly API for rapid development of 2D or 2.5D games. Game created with this
engine can be exported as Desktop (JVM) Game or Android game.

## The goal
The main goal behind the development of this engine is to create feature reach, optimised & community driven engine.
